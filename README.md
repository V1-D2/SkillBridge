# SkillBridge: Shaping the future of mentorship one match at a time

Having equal access to educational opportunities is something we can thank technology for. The role of a mentor is especially important in a student’s life, particularly in today’s competitive markets with an abundance of career paths—paths that can feel overwhelming to navigate alone. A mentor’s guidance can make all the difference!

When we researched existing mentorship programs, we found that many are quite expensive and inaccessible. Even when professionals on platforms like LinkedIn want to help, they often just don’t know which service to use. This limitation inspired us to create SkillBridge: a platform that matches students with mentors based on their interests and the skills they wish to develop.
